# CRABBY #
A texture compression format for spritesheets

## What's gonig on here? ##
This is a webgl build loading the CRABBY source data and displaying it on a webgl canvas

## Buildscript ##
Note, to reduce complexity, this example uses a .raw file for the image data, and a .json file for the metadata; you'll need to export with the proper flags to get these files
