# CRABBY #
A texture compression format for spritesheets

## What's gonig on here? ##
This is a webgl build loading the CRABBY source data and displaying it on a webgl canvas. To run, you'll need to run httpd.py (or run this directory as whatever hosting service you prefer) and load index.html.

## Buildscript ##
Note, to reduce complexity, this example uses a .raw file for the image data, and a .json file for the metadata; you'll need to export with the proper flags to get these files
