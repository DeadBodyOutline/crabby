# CRABBY #

A texture compression format for spritesheets

## What's gonig on here? ##
This is an android native-activity that shows off how to decode a crabby file. Note that the output crabby-encoded files are in the ./assets folder. If you encode a new file with the encoder, you'll need to manually copy it to the assets folder before doing a build.

## Buildscript ##
I provide a handy build.py file which helps to build these android apps on the command line.
