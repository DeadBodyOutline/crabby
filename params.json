Crabby search all the input textures provided, will list all the unique blocks in a single 'pallete texture' image. For each image provided, Crabby will output a 'frame' texture that references, in raster scan order, what 4x4 pixel block should go there. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
