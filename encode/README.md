# CRABBY #
A texture compression format for spritesheets

## What is Crabby? ##
Crabby is an encoder / texture format for creating a compressed sprite sheet with direct-access decompression on the GPU w/o the need for an intermediate texture.

## Why is Crabby? ##
Flipbook texturs often create lots of bloat and are not ideal for Gif and h264 both have to decomp to intermediate RGBA frame before being used in sampling. 
You could, technically use h264 and the disk format, and expand it to an atlas texture later, but that doesnâ€™t decrease GPU footprint.
While these formats create great compression savings for distribution, they often create bloat on the GPU, which can create problems for devices you're running code on.

## What is Crabby's development status? ##
Crabby represents a work in progress to find alternate ways to compress sprite sheets for 2D games.
